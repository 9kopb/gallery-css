# Gallery.css

Gallery.css is *all* CSS. Think: Simple, maintainable and understandable galleries without the use of Javascript. 

_What? No script!? Why?_ — Gallery css started as an experiment to build interactive, fluid componentry without the need for jQuery, or a jQuery carousel script. Use this library, or don't — either way, hopefully you'll learn from the techniques used within. 

### Getting started

You've got a couple options with how you'd like to use gallery.css:

	* Without autoplaying animation
	* With autoplaying animation
	* With or without browser prefixes

### How does it work? 

I've [prepared a screencast](http://benschwarz.github.io/gallery-css) that will take you through how to build something like Gallery-css from scratch, theres tonnes of tiny details that I learnt myself while building it. Its $12, you'll learn and it'll help me keep building for the web. How good is that? 

### Browser support

<table width="100%" style="text-align: center;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Safari</td>
      <td>Firefox</td>
      <td>Chrome</td>
      <td>IE8</td>
      <td>IE9</td>
      <td>IE10</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>✔</td>
      <td>✔</td>
      <td>✔</td>
      <td>✖†</td>
      <td>✔</td>
      <td>✔</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
